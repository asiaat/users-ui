# Users-UI Installation Guide (Vue Project)

## Overview
This guide details the setup process for the "Users-UI" Vue.js project, focusing on Yarn as the package manager and the configuration of Axios for API requests. Ensure you have Node.js v18 or higher for optimal compatibility.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 or higher.
- Yarn package manager.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the "Users-UI" repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/asiaat/users-ui.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Switch to the project directory:
```
cd users-ui
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies using Yarn:
```
yarn install
```

### 4. Configure Axios
Set up Axios for API communication. In your `axios.js` file, specify the base URL for API requests:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// Set the base URL for all Axios requests
axios.defaults.baseURL = "http://localhost:8000";
```
Ensure this URL points to your backend API server.

### 5. Environment Configuration
Create an `.env` file from the `.env.example` template, if available:
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Adjust the `.env` file to suit your local environment, especially the API endpoints.

### 6. Run the Application
Launch the application with Yarn:
```
yarn start
```

## Post-Installation
Your "Users-UI" application should now be running on your local machine. Access it through a web browser to interact with the Vue.js interface.

## Notes
- Regularly update Node.js and Yarn to their latest versions.
- Monitor for any errors during installation or runtime and resolve them as needed.
- The Axios base URL should match the endpoint of your backend services.

## Additional Scripts
Check your `package.json` for other Yarn scripts that may be useful for tasks like testing, building, or linting.
